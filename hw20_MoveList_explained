it takes an XML object and converts it to a string. 

what got printed changed. i think it changed because in the program, numbers
aren't being saved as numbers. so you need toString to convert it back to a 
number before you print it. 

last is being used to show the last value in the array/movelist.

the expand method makes the array bigger with more space for values/moves
i think it's there so that you have space to add more moves if you need it.

remove method will get rid of what was previously in index 0 of the moves array by sliding it over 1 until it reaches the last value. then, it lowers the last value by 1.

it keeps the list of moves that have been made in the moves array

the movelist class when you use it can do more things than a normal list. 
for example, returning values. like makiing the array bigger, removing, add values, and returning it.
